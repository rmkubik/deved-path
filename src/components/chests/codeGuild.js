    <h1>Taught at a Bootcamp</h1>
    <p>
      After I moved to Portland, I started attending local meetups. One was run
      at a bootcamp and they needed someone to teach an intro to programming
      course.
    </p>
    <p>
      I thought that I might enjoy being a teacher before this, but quickly
      learned that is very hard and exhausting.
    </p>
    <p>
      I don't think a conventional classroom setting is in my future!
    </p>
