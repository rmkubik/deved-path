    <h1>"Finished" a Game: Unstable</h1>
    <p>
      I shipped my first "real" project! It wasn't just a prototype or a weekend jam project. It had 3 worlds with almost 30 levels.
    </p>
    <p>
      Unstable is an action arcade game where you dodge robotic enemies and collect coins.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was my first game dev {"&"} side income. A <em>massive</em> $8.23!
    </p>
    <p>
      I learned a ton during this process, especially about the mountain of challenging non-development tasks that are required to actually ship a game.
