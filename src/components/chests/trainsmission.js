    <h1>Global Game Jam 2018: Trainsmission</h1>
    <p>
      This was the first big group project I was part of that succesfully
      finished!
    </p>

    </p>
    <p>
      I made <a href="http://trainsmission.com/" target="_blank">
        a very poorly optimized landing page where you can play it!</a>
