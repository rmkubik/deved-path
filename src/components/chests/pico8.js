    <h1>PICO 8 Workshop</h1>
    <p>
      The <a href="https://pigsquad.com">local game development group in Portland</a> put on an <a href="https://impactflow.com/event/pico-8-workshop-series-with-the-portland-indie-game-squad-5717">educational
      workshop</a> teaching <a href="https://www.lexaloffle.com/pico-8.php">PICO 8</a>. They needed more folks with coding experience to help out as TAs.
    </p>
    <p>
      This was my first time in a workshop setting!
    </p>
    <p>
      This was awesome! This style of education was way more my speed. I really
      enjoyed solving problems with attendees collaboratively.
