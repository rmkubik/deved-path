    <h1>PICO 8 Workshop</h1>
    <p>
      The local game development group in Portland put on an educational
      workshop. They needed more folks with coding experience to help out as
      TAs. This was my first time in a workshop setting!
    </p>
    <p>
      This was awesome! This style of education was way more my speed. I really
      enjoyed solving problems with attendees collabortively.
