    <h1>Started Blogging</h1>
    <p>
      I started blogging by sharing short Today I Learned posts in a GitHub
      repo. Eventually I made my own blog site and started writing a little
      longer posts on non-technical content too.
    </p>
    <p>
      This has been one of my favorite forms of sharing and helping others learn
      thus far.
