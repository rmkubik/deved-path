    <h1>Started Blogging</h1>
    <p>
      I started blogging by sharing short "Today I Learned" <a href="https://github.com/rmkubik/til">posts in a GitHub repo.</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      Eventually I made <a href="https://ryankubik.com/blog">my own blog site</a> and started writing some longer form posts and not only covering technical topics.
    </p>
    <p>
      This has been one of my favorite forms of sharing and helping others learn thus far.
