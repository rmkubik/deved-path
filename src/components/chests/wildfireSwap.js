    <h1>First Commerical Project: Wildfire Swap</h1>
    <p>
      <a href="https://wildfire.fun/" target="_blank">Wildfire Swap</a> is a puzzle game where you protect people's homes from raging forest fires by tile-swapping your way to safety.
    </p>
    <p>
      I've been learning a ton of non-technical skills I've never dealt with before: Marketing, community building, showing at expos, making a downloadable app, etc.
    </p>
    <p>
      A lot of this project has been defined by my failures in the non-technical aspects of shipping Unstable.
