    <h1>Developer Educator!!!</h1>
    <p>
      I've been making games, learning developery stuff, and searching for ways to share all of that with others.
    </p>
    <p>
      I'd be remiss to not acknowledge the privilege that gave me the security to spend my free time learning all of these skills.
    </p>
    <p>
      I'm very fortunate to now be able to apply all of those skills to help create <a href="twilio.com/quest">TwilioQuest</a> (an educational RPG that teaches people to code) as a Developer Educator.
